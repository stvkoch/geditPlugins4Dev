  <comment>&lt;p&gt;Draw a set of diagrams representing the modules and classes in the system. We draw one diagram for each file, and one for each toplevel class or module. This means there will be overlap. However, it also means that you&apos;ll get better context for objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use, simply&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  d = Diagram.new(info)   # pass in collection of top level infos
  d.draw
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results will be written to the &lt;tt&gt;dot&lt;/tt&gt; subdirectory. The process also sets the &lt;tt&gt;diagram&lt;/tt&gt; attribute in each object it graphs to the name of the file containing the image. This can be used by output generators to insert images.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
  <methods>
    <method name='new'>&lt;p&gt;Pass in the set of top level objects. The method also creates the subdirectory to hold the images&lt;/p&gt;</method>
    <method name='draw'>&lt;p&gt;Draw the diagrams. We traverse the files, drawing a diagram for each. We also traverse each top-level class and module in that file drawing a diagram for these too.&lt;/p&gt;</method>
