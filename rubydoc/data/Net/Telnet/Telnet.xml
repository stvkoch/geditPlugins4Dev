  <comment>&lt;h2&gt;Net::Telnet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provides telnet client functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This class also has, through delegation, all the methods of a socket object (by default, a &lt;tt&gt;TCPSocket&lt;/tt&gt;, but can be set by the &lt;tt&gt;Proxy&lt;/tt&gt; option to &lt;tt&gt;new()&lt;/tt&gt;). This provides methods such as &lt;tt&gt;close()&lt;/tt&gt; to end the session and &lt;tt&gt;sysread()&lt;/tt&gt; to read data directly from the host, instead of via the &lt;tt&gt;waitfor()&lt;/tt&gt; mechanism. Note that if you do use &lt;tt&gt;sysread()&lt;/tt&gt; directly when in telnet mode, you should probably pass the output through &lt;tt&gt;preprocess()&lt;/tt&gt; to extract telnet command sequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The telnet protocol allows a client to login remotely to a user account on a server and execute commands via a shell. The equivalent is done by creating a Net::Telnet class with the &lt;tt&gt;Host&lt;/tt&gt; option set to your host, calling #login() with your user and password, issuing one or more #cmd() calls, and then calling #close() to end the session. The #waitfor(), #print(), #puts(), and #write() methods, which #cmd() is implemented on top of, are only needed if you are doing something more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Net::Telnet object can also be used to connect to non-telnet services, such as SMTP or HTTP. In this case, you normally want to provide the &lt;tt&gt;Port&lt;/tt&gt; option to specify the port to connect to, and set the &lt;tt&gt;Telnetmode&lt;/tt&gt; option to false to prevent the client from attempting to interpret telnet command sequences. Generally, #login() will not work with other protocols, and you have to handle authentication yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some protocols, it will be possible to specify the &lt;tt&gt;Prompt&lt;/tt&gt; option once when you create the Telnet object and use #cmd() calls; for others, you will have to specify the response sequence to look for as the Match option to every #cmd() call, or call #puts() and #waitfor() directly; for yet others, you will have to use #sysread() instead of #waitfor() and parse server responses yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that when you create a new Net::Telnet object, you can supply a proxy IO channel via the Proxy option. This can be used to attach the Telnet object to other Telnet objects, to already open sockets, or to any read-write IO object. This can be useful, for instance, for setting up a test fixture for unit testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Log in and send a command, echoing all output to stdout&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  localhost = Net::Telnet::new(&quot;Host&quot; =&gt; &quot;localhost&quot;,
                               &quot;Timeout&quot; =&gt; 10,
                               &quot;Prompt&quot; =&gt; /[$%#&gt;] \z/n)
  localhost.login(&quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;) { |c| print c }
  localhost.cmd(&quot;command&quot;) { |c| print c }
  localhost.close
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Check a POP server to see if you have mail&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  pop = Net::Telnet::new(&quot;Host&quot; =&gt; &quot;your_destination_host_here&quot;,
                         &quot;Port&quot; =&gt; 110,
                         &quot;Telnetmode&quot; =&gt; false,
                         &quot;Prompt&quot; =&gt; /^+OK/n)
  pop.cmd(&quot;user &quot; + &quot;your_username_here&quot;) { |c| print c }
  pop.cmd(&quot;pass &quot; + &quot;your_password_here&quot;) { |c| print c }
  pop.cmd(&quot;list&quot;) { |c| print c }
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a large number of RFCs relevant to the Telnet protocol. RFCs 854-861 define the base protocol. For a complete listing of relevant RFCs, see http://www.omnifarious.org/~hopper/technical/telnet-rfc.html&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
  <methods>
    <method name='new'>&lt;p&gt;Creates a new Net::Telnet object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attempts to connect to the host (unless the Proxy option is provided: see below). If a block is provided, it is yielded status messages on the attempt to connect to the server, of the form:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  Trying localhost...
  Connected to localhost.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;options&lt;/tt&gt; is a hash of options. The following example lists all options and their default values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  host = Net::Telnet::new(
           &quot;Host&quot;       =&gt; &quot;localhost&quot;,  # default: &quot;localhost&quot;
           &quot;Port&quot;       =&gt; 23,           # default: 23
           &quot;Binmode&quot;    =&gt; false,        # default: false
           &quot;Output_log&quot; =&gt; &quot;output_log&quot;, # default: nil (no output)
           &quot;Dump_log&quot;   =&gt; &quot;dump_log&quot;,   # default: nil (no output)
           &quot;Prompt&quot;     =&gt; /[$%#&gt;] \z/n, # default: /[$%#&gt;] \z/n
           &quot;Telnetmode&quot; =&gt; true,         # default: true
           &quot;Timeout&quot;    =&gt; 10,           # default: 10
             # if ignore timeout then set &quot;Timeout&quot; to false.
           &quot;Waittime&quot;   =&gt; 0,            # default: 0
           &quot;Proxy&quot;      =&gt; proxy         # default: nil
                           # proxy is Net::Telnet or IO object
         )
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The options have the following meanings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the hostname or IP address of the host to connect to, as a String. Defaults to &quot;localhost&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the port to connect to. Defaults to 23.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;if false (the default), newline substitution is performed. Outgoing LF is converted to CRLF, and incoming CRLF is converted to LF. If true, this substitution is not performed. This value can also be set with the #binmode() method. The outgoing conversion only applies to the #puts() and #print() methods, not the #write() method. The precise nature of the newline conversion is also affected by the telnet options SGA and BIN.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the name of the file to write connection status messages and all received traffic to. In the case of a proper Telnet session, this will include the client input as echoed by the host; otherwise, it only includes server responses. Output is appended verbatim to this file. By default, no output log is kept.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as for Output_log, except that output is written in hexdump format (16 bytes per line as hex pairs, followed by their printable equivalent), with connection status messages preceded by &apos;#&apos;, sent traffic preceded by &apos;&gt;&apos;, and received traffic preceded by &apos;&lt;&apos;. By default, not dump log is kept.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a regular expression matching the host&apos;s command-line prompt sequence. This is needed by the Telnet class to determine when the output from a command has finished and the host is ready to receive a new command. By default, this regular expression is /[$%#&gt;] \z/n.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a boolean value, true by default. In telnet mode, traffic received from the host is parsed for special command sequences, and these sequences are escaped in outgoing traffic sent using #puts() or #print() (but not #write()). If you are using the Net::Telnet object to connect to a non-telnet service (such as SMTP or POP), this should be set to &quot;false&quot; to prevent undesired data corruption. This value can also be set by the #telnetmode() method.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the number of seconds to wait before timing out both the initial attempt to connect to host (in this constructor), and all attempts to read data from the host (in #waitfor(), #cmd(), and #login()). Exceeding this timeout causes a TimeoutError to be raised. The default value is 10 seconds. You can disable the timeout by setting this value to false. In this case, the connect attempt will eventually timeout on the underlying connect(2) socket call with an Errno::ETIMEDOUT error (but generally only after a few minutes), but other attempts to read data from the host will hand indefinitely if no data is forthcoming.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the amount of time to wait after seeing what looks like a prompt (that is, received data that matches the Prompt option regular expression) to see if more data arrives. If more data does arrive in this time, Net::Telnet assumes that what it saw was not really a prompt. This is to try to avoid false matches, but it can also lead to missing real prompts (if, for instance, a background process writes to the terminal soon after the prompt is displayed). By default, set to 0, meaning not to wait for more data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a proxy object to used instead of opening a direct connection to the host. Must be either another Net::Telnet object or an IO object. If it is another Net::Telnet object, this instance will use that one&apos;s socket for communication. If an IO object, it is used directly for communication. Any other kind of object will cause an error to be raised.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</method>
    <method name='binmode'>&lt;p&gt;Turn newline conversion on (&lt;tt&gt;mode&lt;/tt&gt; == false) or off (&lt;tt&gt;mode&lt;/tt&gt; == true), or return the current value (&lt;tt&gt;mode&lt;/tt&gt; is not specified).&lt;/p&gt;</method>
    <method name='binmode='>&lt;p&gt;Turn newline conversion on (false) or off (true).&lt;/p&gt;</method>
    <method name='cmd'>&lt;p&gt;Send a command to the host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More exactly, sends a string to the host, and reads in all received data until is sees the prompt or other matched sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a block is given, the received data will be yielded to it as it is read in. Whether a block is given or not, the received data will be return as a string. Note that the received data includes the prompt and in most cases the host&apos;s echo of our command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;options&lt;/tt&gt; is either a String, specified the string or command to send to the host; or it is a hash of options. If a hash, the following options can be specified:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the command or other string to send to the host.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a regular expression, the sequence to look for in the received data before returning. If not specified, the Prompt option value specified when this instance was created will be used, or, failing that, the default prompt of /[$%#&gt;] \z/n.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the seconds to wait for data from the host before raising a Timeout error. If not specified, the Timeout option value specified when this instance was created will be used, or, failing that, the default value of 10 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The command or other string will have the newline sequence appended to it.&lt;/p&gt;</method>
    <method name='login'>&lt;p&gt;Login to the host with a given username and password.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The username and password can either be provided as two string arguments in that order, or as a hash with keys &quot;Name&quot; and &quot;Password&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method looks for the strings &quot;login&quot; and &quot;Password&quot; from the host to determine when to send the username and password. If the login sequence does not follow this pattern (for instance, you are connecting to a service other than telnet), you will need to handle login yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The password can be omitted, either by only provided one String argument, which will be used as the username, or by providing a has that has no &quot;Password&quot; key. In this case, the method will not look for the &quot;Password:&quot; prompt; if it is sent, it will have to be dealt with by later calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method returns all data received during the login process from the host, including the echoed username but not the password (which the host should not echo). If a block is passed in, this received data is also yielded to the block as it is received.&lt;/p&gt;</method>
    <method name='preprocess'>&lt;p&gt;Preprocess received data from the host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performs newline conversion and detects telnet command sequences. Called automatically by #waitfor(). You should only use this method yourself if you have read input directly using sysread() or similar, and even then only if in telnet mode.&lt;/p&gt;</method>
    <method name='print'>&lt;p&gt;Sends a string to the host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; automatically append a newline to the string. Embedded newlines may be converted and telnet command sequences escaped depending upon the values of telnetmode, binmode, and telnet options set by the host.&lt;/p&gt;</method>
    <method name='puts'>&lt;p&gt;Sends a string to the host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same as #print(), but appends a newline to the string.&lt;/p&gt;</method>
    <method name='telnetmode'>&lt;p&gt;Set telnet command interpretation on (&lt;tt&gt;mode&lt;/tt&gt; == true) or off (&lt;tt&gt;mode&lt;/tt&gt; == false), or return the current value (&lt;tt&gt;mode&lt;/tt&gt; not provided). It should be on for true telnet sessions, off if using Net::Telnet to connect to a non-telnet service such as SMTP.&lt;/p&gt;</method>
    <method name='telnetmode='>&lt;p&gt;Turn telnet command interpretation on (true) or off (false). It should be on for true telnet sessions, off if using Net::Telnet to connect to a non-telnet service such as SMTP.&lt;/p&gt;</method>
    <method name='waitfor'>&lt;p&gt;Read data from the host until a certain sequence is matched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a block is given, the received data will be yielded as it is read in (not necessarily all in one go), or nil if EOF occurs before any data is received. Whether a block is given or not, all data read will be returned in a single string, or again nil if EOF occurs before any data is received. Note that received data includes the matched sequence we were looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;options&lt;/tt&gt; can be either a regular expression or a hash of options. If a regular expression, this specifies the data to wait for. If a hash, this can specify the following options:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a regular expression, specifying the data to wait for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as for Match; used only if Match is not specified.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as for Match, except a string that will be converted into a regular expression. Used only if Match and Prompt are not specified.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the number of seconds to wait for data from the host before raising a TimeoutError. If set to false, no timeout will occur. If not specified, the Timeout option value specified when this instance was created will be used, or, failing that, the default value of 10 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the number of seconds to wait after matching against the input data to see if more data arrives. If more data arrives within this time, we will judge ourselves not to have matched successfully, and will continue trying to match. If not specified, the Waittime option value specified when this instance was created will be used, or, failing that, the default value of 0 seconds, which means not to wait for more input.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</method>
    <method name='write'>&lt;p&gt;Write &lt;tt&gt;string&lt;/tt&gt; to the host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does not perform any conversions on &lt;tt&gt;string&lt;/tt&gt;. Will log &lt;tt&gt;string&lt;/tt&gt; to the dumplog, if the Dump_log option is set.&lt;/p&gt;</method>
