  <comment>&lt;p&gt;IPSocket is the parent of TCPSocket and UDPSocket and implements functionality common to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of APIs in IPSocket, Socket, and their descendants return an address as an array. The members of that array are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;address family: A string like &quot;AF_INET&quot; or &quot;AF_INET6&quot; if it is one of the commonly used families, the string &quot;unknown:#&quot; (where `#&apos; is the address family number) if it is not one of the common ones. The strings map to the Socket::AF_* constants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;port: The port number.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;name: Either the canonical name from looking the address up in the DNS, or the address in presentation format&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;address: The address in presentation format (a dotted decimal string for IPv4, a hex string for IPv6).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The address and port can be used directly to create sockets and to bind or connect them to the address.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
